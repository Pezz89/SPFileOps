# SPFileOps

File ops is a module containing a selection of file related operations that I commonly use when developing Python applications.
Currently only contains a small selection of filepath related operations though this will be expanded as I develope related projects and new functions are needed.

The hope is that this will be expanded in the future to incorporate my SPPySound to produce a section of easy to use audio related operations for common audio file operations.
Stereo to mono mixdown operation is the simplest function that springs to mind...
